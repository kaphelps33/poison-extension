# Poison: A productivity extension

This is mainly a project to help me learn JavaScript and basic web interactions.

## Expectations

To make a functional extension that makes YouTube much less enjoyable to use.

1. The page takes longer to load.
2. No recommended videos, comments, shorts, etc...
3. Introduce interruptions to a video making it much less enjoyable to watch.
4. A 'podcast' mode that will let you listen to a video but not show the actual video.
   Right now I do not know how many of these is possible but I am excited to learn!
